services described in this Order and are incorporated herein and made a part of
this Order. This Order constitutes the entire agreement between Buyer, Oakfield

&quot;Buyer&quot;) and Seller (&quot;Seller&quot;) with respect to the purchase
of products and/or services described herein and replaces all prior and
contemporaneous agreements, representations and/or understandings whether oral
or written, which may have related to the subject matter in any way. If there
are any discrepancies between information in the attachments (if any), and
statements made in this Order, the terms of such attachments shall not prevail
over inconsistent terms herein unless so acknowledged in writing by Buyer. This
Order includes as part of its terms the specifications provided by Buyer for
goods or services whether provided with, prior to, or after this Order, but
prior to shipment of the Order.</p>

<p>2.ACCEPTANCE OF PURCHASE ORDER: Seller's acknowledgement of
this Order or commencement of performance hereunder constitutes Seller's
acceptance of the terms and conditions herein. Acceptance by Seller of the
Order is expressly limited to the terms hereof to the exclusion of all other or
additional terms. Acceptance of the products or services delivered under this
Order shall not constitute acceptance of Seller's terms and conditions.
Acceptance of this Order is expressly limited to the terms and conditions of
this Order and shall not be modified, supplemented or altered (including by
prior course of performance or dealings) except in writing stating that the
writing is a modification or supplement of this Order and signed by an
authorized representative of Buyer. Seller must furnish the entire quantity
ordered hereunder. Seller shall not vary the quantity unless an authorized
representative of Buyer prior to shipment agrees to accept a different
quantity. If the Order does not provide otherwise, tolerances for quantity
variations will be permitted in accordance with the specific industry accepted
practices. Reference in this Order to Seller's proposal or quotation is only to
describe the goods or services covered and does not constitute an acceptance of
any terms therein. Seller's written or electronic confirmation of this Order or
the shipment of the goods or performance of the services shall constitute
acceptance of this Order. Notwithstanding prior inspection or payment, if the
goods are nonconforming, defective, of inferior quality, not in accordance with
specifications (e.g., quantity, temperature, labeling), or fail to meet any
warranty hereunder, Buyer may reject such goods. Goods rejected may be returned
to Seller, or held by Buyer, at Seller's risk and expense.</p>

<p>3.DELIVERY: If delivery of goods is not complete by the time
specified (time is of the essence) or if Seller breaches any terms hereof
including, without limitation, Seller's warranties, Buyer reserves the right
(in addition to other rights and remedies) to cancel without cost or penalty
all or any part of the undelivered portion of this Order. Damage to goods not
packed, marked, and shipped in accordance with requirements of Buyer or
shipping instructions, and of common carriers are charged to Seller. Goods must
be delivered at the delivery point specified in the Order. If goods are
incorrectly delivered or kept at the incorrect temperature, Seller is
responsible for any additional expense incurred in delivering them to their
correct destination. Services shall be carried out at the location specified in
the Order.</p>

<p>4.PAYMENT TERMS: Payments shall be net thirty (30) days,
unless otherwise specified herein. Invoice price shall not exceed the price on
the Order. In the case of a cash discount, the discount period shall be
calculated from the later of the date the invoice is received by the Buyer or
the date on which Buyer receives the goods. Unless otherwise shown on the face
of this Order, the prices stated on the face of this Order include all federal,
state, and local taxes, import duties, license fees, or other government
charges, if any, applicable to this Order. Seller agrees that all taxes will be
separately stated on invoices provided to Buyer. All goods purchased hereunder
are subject to Buyer's final inspection, test, and approval after delivery to
Buyer. Payments to Seller will be made via Automated Clearing House
(&quot;ACH&quot;).</p>

<p>5.CHANGES/CANCELLATION: Buyer may make changes at any time
in the specifications relating to this Order by giving written notice to
Seller. If Seller is unable to provide goods with the requested changes or if
Buyer and Seller cannot agree on a mutually agreeable price for such changes,
Buyer may cancel under the terms set forth herein, Buyer may cancel this Order
prior to shipment in whole or in part at its convenience upon written notice
without prejudice to other rights under Order.</p>

<p>6.ACCEPTANCE OF GOODS: No inspection or test made prior to
final acceptance relieves Seller from responsibility for defects or other
failure to meet the Order's requirements. Seller shall carefully inspect all
goods prior to shipment. Buyer shall have the right to reject Seller's supplies
of goods or services within a reasonable time of their delivery or completion
and to cancel Order if goods or services do not conform with the terms and
conditions of Order or applicable contract. Any payment made by Buyer shall not
prejudice Buyer's right of rejection or any other right which Buyer may have.
Failure or refusal to permit such inspections shall subject this Order to
cancellation without liability to Buyer. Seller shall assume all responsibility
for defective product(s) including, without limitation, the costs for
collection and proper storage, return shipment, recall or withdrawal and
destruction of the product, and the reasonable and unavoidable costs incurred
by Buyer as a result of the recall or product withdrawal including, without
limitation, re-packing of finished goods boxes which contained the
recall/withdrawal product(s), labor, transportation, expedited shipping, and
Buyerâ€™s customer(s) refunds.</p>

<p>7.PASSING OF PROPERTY AND RISK TO BUYER: Seller keeps title
and risk in the goods until delivered at the point specified in the Order,
transferred to Buyer's possession and accepted by Buyer, at which time title
and risk in the goods shall transfer except as otherwise provided herein.
Seller is liable for risk of loss or damage to goods until the goods have been
delivered, transferred and accepted by Buyer irrespective of which party
selects the shipper or pays for shipping.</p>

<p>8.FORCE MAJEURE: Neither party shall be liable under Order
for its failure or delay in fulfilling its obligations if the failure or delay
is the result of circumstances, which are beyond the party's reasonable control
or of priorities or allocations caused by (but not limited to) fire,
governmental authority, unusually severe weather, strikes or labor
disturbances, lockout, public enemy, prohibitions, acts of the other party
hereto, invasions, insurrections, riots, civil war or commotion, delays of a
similar nature, military or usurped owner or acts of God (&quot;Force
Majeure&quot;). Buyer shall have the option to cancel the Purchase Order upon
such Force Majeure. Due diligence shall be used in curing such cause and in
resuming performance. The increase in costs of goods to Seller shall not be a
Force Majeure.</p>

<p>9.ASSIGNMENT AND SUB-CONTRACTING: Seller shall not assign or
subcontract any of its rights, interests or obligations under Order without the
prior written consent of Buyer. Notwithstanding Buyer's consent to any
assignment or subcontract, Seller shall be responsible for all services and

consequences of this Agreement shall be first attempted to be settled by

rules of arbitration by a single arbitrator appointed by the AAA in accordance
with AAA rules. The arbitration shall take place in Dallas, Texas. The award of
the arbitrator may be entered and enforced in any court having competent
jurisdiction. The arbitrator will have no power to award non-monetary or
equitable relief of any sort. The arbitrator will also have no power to award damages
inconsistent with the Limitations on Liability provisions set forth in this
Agreement. Each party accepts and acknowledges that any demand for arbitration
arising from or in connection with this Agreement must be issued within one
year from the date the party became aware or should reasonably have become
aware of the facts that give rise to any alleged liability and in any event no
later than two years after any such cause of action accrued. The parties waive
their respective rights to a trial by jury with respect to any cause of action,
claim or counterclaim in any action, proceeding or hearing. Each Party shall
bear its own costs associated with arbitration and the fees for the arbitrator
will be shared equally by the parties.</p>

SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FINES
OR PENALTIES, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR UNFORESEEABLE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT,
WARRANTY OR OTHERWISE. Either party may waive performance of any condition and
treat it as a warranty. No waiver of breach of any provision herein shall
constitute a waiver of any other breach of such provision or of any other
provision or of any provision under future Orders. Notwithstanding the
foregoing limitations set forth above, damages may include value of lost
profits associated with a product recall or withdrawal or loss of Buyer's
customers resulting from Seller providing adulterated, misbranded or contaminated
goods intended for human consumption or the packaging of goods intended for
human consumption. All claims for money due or to become due from Buyer shall
be subject to deduction or setoff by Buyer.</p>

these terms and conditions, and all proprietary information or data furnished
by disclosing party to receiving party in connection with the performance of
